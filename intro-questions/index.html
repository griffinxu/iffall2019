			<li>Griffin Xu. Double major in Communication Design and Marketing. Junior</li>
			<li>I'm from Shanghai, China and I'm interested in working in the marketing and advertising area. I'm taking this class because I want to gain skills regarding website and app development, which hopefully will further my understanding in design.</li>
			<li>I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
			<li>I look forward to learning how to code my own website.</li>
			<li>Designing for screen will be more interactive when the audience is displayed to a site with much more engaging experience than designing for paper.</li>
			<li>https://www.mikiyakobayashi.com I like this website's design because it first starts with this designer's projects which really speaks to me that leads me to have a first impression on his work rather than his profile. I can also tell that the designer who showcases his work in this way is a confident designer as he believes his work can represent himself. In addition, I personally like the layout as he hits audience with his massive amount of works but organized them in a neat way that I won't feel overwhilmed.</li>
			<li>https://www.ideo.com/ I enjoy reading Ideo's website because it functions more than just a company's official website as it includes information and news that are relevant to the design world, but are clearly designed in a way that these information won't conflict with company's information while showing me how the company also relies on these content. Therefore this website is a good example of effective communication.  </li>
			<li>https://www.google.com/ Google is my favorite searching engine because the site is so clean and user-friendly yet with thoughtful details. Besides being a powerful searching website, it also has Google store tab, gmail, google image and more menus for people to eadily navigate.The I'm Feeling Lucky tab is a good add-on as a little fun part for users to play with and all of these elements work well together.</li>
