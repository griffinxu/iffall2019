		<h1>Alex K's Postcard Triptych Feedback</h1>
		<h2>From Griffin Xu</h2>
		<h3>First<h3>
		<li>Possibly put the quote to the right top of the image for desktop version, as how it's positioned in the mobile version, as if the character is looking at the quote</li>
		<h3>Second<h3>
		<li>I would try to show some contrast between the two quotes to show the dialogue context besides the placement of the quotes; maybe the type size of quote on the short-sleeve guy could be smaller</li>
		<h3>Third<h3>
		<li>Instead of a solid shape, maybe a gradient with dark shadow or blur to show the quote more legible</li>
		<li>I would also move the quote between the two people instead of putting it at the bottom; the source of the quote to the right</li>
		<h3>Additional Notes<h3>
		<li>To unify the theme and style of the triptych, I might treat the photos with the same colored layer or some texture</li>
		<li>The type choices are bold and legible, which seems to fit the character</li>
